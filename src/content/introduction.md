- Virtual DOM
- JSX
- State
- Props
- Children
- Stateless vs Stateful Components

# What is React?

- At this point we should know it consists of: components, state, props and JSX.
- To build interactivity, we combine callbacks (methods) with props, and state
- As apps get bigger, it solves a huge problem we have had in the past. React has these walls to guide you in this style of mentality. So when you build apps, you are using good practices.
